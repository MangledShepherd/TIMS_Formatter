TIPS FOR MOBILE:
----------------

âœ“ Bookmarklet should start with "javascript:"
  If it doesn't, you pasted the wrong thing

âœ“ The code is VERY long (10,000+ characters)
  This is normal! Don't worry about it.

âœ“ Some browsers might complain
  Try a different browser if one doesn't work

âœ“ You only need to set this up once
  The bookmark stays in your browser

âœ“ Works offline (after loading TIMS)
  Once you load the TIMS page, the bookmarklet works

================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING MOBILE:
-----------------------

"The bookmark does nothing"
â†’ Make sure the URL starts with "javascript:"
â†’ Make sure you copied the ENTIRE code
â†’ Try deleting and recreating the bookmark

"Can't find my bookmarks"
â†’ iPhone Safari: Tap the book icon
â†’ Android Chrome: Menu â†’ Bookmarks
â†’ Android Firefox: Type bookmark name in address bar

"The code won't paste"
â†’ Make sure you tapped "Copy Bookmarklet" first
â†’ Try copying again
â†’ Some browsers: long-press the URL field to paste

"Page goes blank"
â†’ You might not be on the roster page
â†’ Make sure you're logged into TIMS first
â†’ Refresh the TIMS roster page and try again

================================================================

STILL NEED HELP?
----------------

1. Check the "ðŸ“± Mobile" tab in install.html
   It has detailed instructions with screenshots

2. Try using a different browser
   Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all work

3. Make sure you're copying the ENTIRE code
   It's over 10,000 characters - that's normal!

================================================================

That's it! Once set up, you just tap the bookmark whenever
you're viewing your TIMS roster and it formats instantly.
