## 💡 How It Works

The bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript that runs directly on the TIMS website:

1. You click the bookmark while viewing your TIMS roster
2. The script reads the roster table data from the current page
3. It filters out duplicate entries and organizes the data
4. A new formatted page replaces the TIMS page
5. You see your roster in an easy-to-read, mobile-friendly format

**No data leaves your browser - everything runs locally!**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### The bookmarklet doesn't appear to do anything

- Make sure you're on the TIMS roster page (not the login page)
- Try refreshing the TIMS roster page first, then click the bookmark

### Dates are showing incorrectly

- This version uses your local timezone - dates should be correct
- Make sure your computer/phone's date and time are set correctly

### On mobile, I can't drag the button

- Use the "📱 Mobile" tab in install.html
- Copy the bookmarklet code and create the bookmark manually
- See MOBILE_SETUP.txt for detailed instructions
