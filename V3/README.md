# TIMS Live Roster Formatter - V3

**One-tap formatting of your TIMS roster - simplified for mobile!**

---

## Quick Setup (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Copy the Bookmarklet Code

Copy this entire line:

```
javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MangledShepherd/TIMS_Formatter@main/tims_live_formatter.js';document.head.appendChild(s);})();
```

### Step 2: Create a Bookmark

1. **Create a new bookmark** in your mobile browser
2. **Name it:** `F` (just the letter F - makes it easy to search)
3. **Paste** the code from Step 1 as the bookmark URL

### Step 3: Done!

You're ready to use it!

---

## How to Use

1. **Open your TIMS roster page** in your mobile browser
2. **Tap the address bar** and type `F`
3. **Select your "F" bookmark** from the suggestions
4. **Your roster is now formatted!**

### Why search for it instead of opening from bookmarks?

On most mobile browsers (especially Brave, Chrome), you can't run a bookmarklet on an existing page from the bookmarks menu - it tries to open it as a new page. The workaround is to search for it in the address bar, which runs the bookmarklet on the current page.

## What's Different in V3?

**V3 is simplified:**

V3 cuts right to the chase - just the short link and simple instructions.

## Troubleshooting

**The bookmarklet doesn't do anything:**
- Make sure you're on the TIMS roster page (not the login page)
- Try refreshing the TIMS page first

**Can't find the bookmark when searching:**
- Make sure you named it "F" (capital F)
- Try typing "format" if "F" doesn't work

**Dates look wrong:**
- Check your phone's date/time settings
- Make sure automatic timezone is enabled

## For Developers

Want to customize the formatter? See `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for technical documentation.

The bookmarklet loads the script from GitHub, so any updates to `tims_live_formatter.js` are automatically available to all users.

---

## Privacy & Security

- **No data collection** - Everything runs in your browser
- **No external servers** - Script doesn't send data anywhere
- **Open source** - You can read the code in `tims_live_formatter.js`

---

## Share With Coworkers

To share this with someone:

1. **Send them the bookmarklet code** (from `bookmarklet_short.txt`)
2. **Tell them:**
   - Create a bookmark named "F"
   - Paste the code as the URL
   - Use it by searching "F" in the address bar on TIMS

Or just send them this whole folder!
